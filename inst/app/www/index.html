                 <p>Wheat is one of the world's three leading cereal crops that include rice and corn, providing about 20%  of the calories we consume every day, and is also a leading source of protein. However, the global wheat supply
                 and demand has become critical in recent years due to global environmental changes
and population growth, and an increase in wheat production by more than 60% over the next 40 years
has been deemed indispensable. In addition, in response to the emergence of new threats such as
the outbreak of wheat blast disease, it is urgent to develop wheat varieties that are resistant to
environmental changes for sustainable production. In Japan, it is also necessary to increase domestic
wheat production and develop varieties with high yield, excellent milling quality, as well as varieties
with sufficient resistance to pre-harvest sprouting, Fusarium head blight etc. often caused by Japan's
wet climate</p>
